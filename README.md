Aquarium Automation

Use this to control a wall power relay with arduino uno wired to LED momentary button.

On button push start timer for 5 minutes (300000 ms). When interval 
ends, turn relay back on.

Button stays on when relay is on, flashes when relay is off with timer going, stays off
when relay is permanently off (no timer going).
